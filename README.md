## Installation

To install dependencies:

```

To install Gulp on the command line:

```
sudo npm install --global gulp-cli
```

## Development

To start the server with Gulp (Nodemon, BrowserSync, Sass compiler, Autoprefixer):

```shell
npm run start:dev
```
This command will open http://localhost:5000/ in a new tab. Upon saving your work, Gulp will automatically compile Sass, add CSS prefixes, and reload the page.
